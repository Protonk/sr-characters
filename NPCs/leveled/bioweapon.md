####Role:

Bio weapon.

Optimal offensive combat with bioware is about taking physical risks. Pain editor + adrenaline pump means you dish out maximum pain without incoming damage getting in the way for a short period. With the right initiative boosts you could have multiple combat turns with 4 passes each all dishing out damage with no wound modifiers. 

During those turns his offensive capacity is huge; the adrelanine pump adds +3 to combat stats. With Kamikaze we have max init and more physical stats. 10 WIL + 4 magic resist means mages hoping to capitalize on a dump stat are out of luck.

Turn on the pain editor and we have +5 WIL and near total immunity to stun damage. Most battles may need only the adrenaline pump, some may need every tool available.

He's a very effective asset for an hour or two of combat, but long engagements or fruitless chases will wear on him. His biomonitor calls in a HRT when the adrenaline pump is triggered (and tells them to step on it if the pain editor is turned on)--he may have them wait on standby. But if he's under fire he may need an extraction because crashing will be rough. I'm confident he'll pass repeated composure tests to turn the pump on (esp w/ pain editor and/or drugs) but adrenaline pumps are dangerous.

So there you go. To kill him just lure this unstoppable killing machine through a long chase and fight off his HRT (and possibly him) until he collapses. Good luck with that. Or you could bring rockets or something.

High value courier/fixer for Wuxing. Can steal data with zero possibility of interception, defend targets with incredible ferocity or storm a compound with a small team. 

If captured, the data lock is very likely a total loss. It can be cracked, but it will only contain data from the most recent operation. His memory of ops and orders, however...
