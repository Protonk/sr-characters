###Hannibal

####Role:

Magic hunter. Good at magical combat, great at defending against or killing mages. If I can get in melee range, I'm 12 to make contact with shatter (and I win ties), which with edge can reliably deal a fair bit of damage.

+5 spell resistance (so resist physical and mana at 10). Counterpselling is 8 dice for combat spells, so I could potentially resist a spell per turn at 17-18. Rolls 14 for combat spells. Resists drain at 9.

Start with lots of karma, because adept points (and a focus) need to be bought (and I need cash--9 karma there). I don't need to buy spells (I did improve STR to 2), so I got one skill.
