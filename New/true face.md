####Ramona

####Role:

True face.

Can potentially roll 13-16 impersonation and 14-18 con on the spot. A good disguise--which they're well equipped to make--will have them rolling 20 impersonating someone face to face. 

Etiquette and negotiation tests are lower (9-11) because she's a con artist. A magic user may make her for a physical adept, but almost all adept talents are devoted to deception (plus a mentor spirit). Karma is spent on two active skills, 4,000 Y with the remainder in contacts. 

With the support of a good team, she could bug nearly any building in Seattle. Oh, and she's got plenty of recording equipment and broad electronics knowledge. Not so hot at combat--versatile, but no great shakes.

####Bio:

Not so much the con artist with a heart of gold, but the con artist who has thanksgiving plans to keep. She's still nominally a UCAS citizen, but her parents are stuck in Denver and the paperwork is endless, so getting anything means working in the shadows. She didn't start off as a runner. That trendy bag you saw a d-list celebrity wear to a trid award show? Probably one of her knockoffs, right down to faking the branded RFID tags. 

Over time she realized that spiriting information in bits and pieces from a tight lipped corporation was more profitable when the target was something like a missile system. She can plant information (or an incriminating object) just as easily. 

####SINs:

Real: Jessica Knox
* Born April 8, 2051 in Redmond Washington
* Parents moved to Denver and remain there as UCAS ex-patriates
	* UCAS citizens, formerly Boeing wageslaves for a weapons division
* Magic adept
