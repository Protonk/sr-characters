###Whistler

####Role:

Pure decker. Cyberware mostly limited to decking, with some attempt to add some attack dice. Great at building bugs, less great at planting them.

20 karma spent on increasing dump stats (CHA/WIL). Plenty of skills geared toward support/decking. Major downside is very poor first initiative roll.
