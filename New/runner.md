###Max

####Role:

Ganger prince. This is the maximally minimal rigger/decker/runner. No major dump stats; can control drones, cars, and turrets; can hack devices or secure a team against countermeasures effectively; and he's not a complete pushover in combat.

Lots of money (450k) chosen for a deck and a range of expensive but targeted bioware/headware. Some karma spent on raising CHA and a few skills.
