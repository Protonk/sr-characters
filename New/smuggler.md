###Bishop

####Role:

He can roll up looking like a regular ganger or a suit. Even a citizen if you squinted (and mislaid your cyberware detector). 12 to hit with the SMG is acceptable, and he'll always have 2 initiative passes. But damage absorption is where it's at. 21 armor w/ the jacket, 11 base DR and platelets means he can tank a lot of hits. +4 on all healing rolls and he's knowledgable enough to repair cyberware. Multiple tough runs in a week will be fine for this guy.

Ideally, he can smuggle his way around that kind of engagement. Lots of skills with cyberware knowledge (namely scanners), repair, and implantation. He can hide an item in the smuggling compartment and disguise its contents to scanners (A long term test, rolling between 7 and 10). A good outcome (5 net hits) gives a concealability of 6-10 even to some scanners. That's his real value.

####Bio:

Specialized smuggler. He looks like muscle, but he's sharp. Not decked out enough to cause alarm, he soaks damage and heals quickly. Crucial edges when forcing someone to act out of overconfidence. Or when you're trying to get a package stuffed in a very private place into a meet between two rival gangs.

Incidently, that's one talent he quite likes to keep hidden. Let's just say he'd like to keep all offers to "double up" on a run discrete and serious. With a scanner and a surgery station at home he can test different setups before deciding on the best. He's consistently good at what he does, and the loyalty of his contacts reflects that. 

####SINs:
