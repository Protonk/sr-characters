####Bio:

####Role:

A specialist. He rolls 20 to hit with the sniper rifle. He will hit 85% of the time. 50% of those hits will kill the average NPC threat in medium armor outright. That's all you really have to say for combat.

He's also a journeyman decker. The deck he has couldn't hack a vending machine but he's got a very nice commlink and lots of tools (as well as the skills to use them).
