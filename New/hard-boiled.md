####Bio:

Mystic adept version of the occult investigator. Able to astrally perceive (and do combat with magic), their skill set is focused on tracking down magicians and artificers through forensics or an information network. If you need to find a hermit or a way in to a heavily warded compound and no one else can do it, you call her.

####Role:

Combat is workable in most cases, but excels against magicians. 18 combat spell resistance is absurd. 

Perception and assensing are boosted, as are investigatory magic skills. Astral chameleon and a masking focus are chosen to better sneak up on quarry--attempts to detect my astral signature are at -5.
