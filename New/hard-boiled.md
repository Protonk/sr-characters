####Bio:



####Role:

A very physical version of the occult investigator. Able to astrally perceive (and do combat with spirits), their skill set is focused on tracking down magicians and artificers through forensics or an information network. If you need to find a hermit or a way in to a heavily warded compound and no one else can do it, you call her. 

Combat is fairly well rounded, with nothing spectacular save the ability to deal physical damage with unarmed + AGI (11) for physical stuff and astral combat + WIL (12) for magic stuff. It's just 6P/S for both, but that's some damage.

Perception and assensing are boosted, as is intuition and willpower. Astral chameleon is chosen to better sneak up on quarry, first impression to smooth the way along that information network. These skills will further the legwork in any run, but are perfect for investigating magic.
