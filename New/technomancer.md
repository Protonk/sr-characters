####Bio:

This here's a regular citizen, friend of the community. He's got a small business and everything. But it's a front. He bribed the right people and runs a small decker bar in a little corner of the grid. He'll drop by as a technomancer, posing as a quiet semi-regular, but both the customers and staff beleive the owner to be an absentee landlord; an admin who provided security and hired a manager to run the place, it looks like there's money laundering going on but everybody gets paid so who cares?

That's just for fun. 

He's also a runner of sorts. He's good for infiltrating hosts (though doing so against black IC is dangerous), but he's superlative at legwork. He always knows a guy and if he doesn't, he can sneak around on the matrix to find what he's looking for.

####Role:

I have no idea how technomancers work, so I picked skills and forms that looks good. I loaded up on contacts (like 15 karma), because I was up to my limits for karma purchases (no Cf, 4 sprites). The idea here is this character has various contacts with their "business" identity or their technomancer identity. They can arrange meets for people or work out very specific bribes for the right official. they know enough languages that quiet listening in at the bar (lots of technomancer stuff for this) will offer some nuggets as well.

But they're also (presumably) skilled in blowing things up in the matrix. The matrix attributes come from LOG, CHA, INT, and WIL. All of these (except CHA) are 5 or higher. RES is 6. Software (the computer skill I need for technomancer stuff) and the technomancer skills are all maxed. Physical combat is basically a loss (4 to hit for the pistol), but some social skills and high CHA allow for a little bit of talking it out.

I figured I'd pay for the bar (no reason to exploit it and treat it as net income) as a middle lifestyle cost (paid out for 4 months). they have to maintain their house (low, obscure) and the imputed cost of the bar--bribes to security, registration with the grid, salary--net from the income provided by the bar.
