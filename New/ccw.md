###Name

####Role:

Close combat specialist/tank. High body for a human, with extra damage resistance due to 2 cyberlimbs. High money cost to minimize essense lost. Big problem with tanks: in good armor, most damage gets turned into stun, but they only have so many stun boxes. We mitigate this with the adrelaline pump and high willpower. 

Solid muscle for a group of 3-5. Good grouping of skills for a supporting role. 

10 karma to boost CHA to 2. 11 to skills.
