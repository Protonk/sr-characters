####Handle:

TIO

####Bio:

This character is...not a thinker. He's bigger than everyone else and he knows it, so minor social problems like not being let into a club or getting brushed off by someone with social status that other people might've ignored tend to get solved with his fists. Or his axe. Or any of the various firearms he has on his person at all times. Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. Along the way he's discovered that cyberware helps it work: a lot.

He's strong enough to rip a car door off its hinges before the driver peels away, but not quite wise enough to realize that's a worse option than tailing the driver, even when he's idling in front of a security station. For jobs requiring finesse, planning and poise he's a liability. For everything else he's a necessity.

####Role:

Tank. The amount of incoming damage this character can take is absurd. 22 armor and 9 to dodge so almost every damage resistance roll will be body + modified armor: potentially 20 DR for every hit that lands. If they do land, any hit >1 gets reduced by 1 and the character can take 5 hits before facing a wound penalty. Hit with an assault rifle with APDS rounds, they still roll 16 to resist damage (with few net hits, the damage could be stun!).

####SINs:
