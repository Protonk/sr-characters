####Handle:

TIO

####Bio:


####Role:

Tank. The amount of incoming damage this character can take is absurd. 23 armor means almost every damage resistance roll will be body + modified armor: potentially 20 DR for every hit that lands. Hit with an assault rifle with APDS rounds, they still roll 15 to resist damage. If they do land, any hit >1 gets reduced by 1 and the character can take 5 hits before facing a wound penalty (6 for stun, so splitting tracks will be valuable).

They're fair at offense: 11 to hit with the axe, and 9 to hit with the concealed pistol. Real advantage comes from soaking up ***GOBS*** of damage.

####SINs:
