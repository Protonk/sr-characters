####Bio:



####Role:

15 to hit with the katana at 11P -3AP. Against relatively unarmored targets, this should be pretty effective. 12 to hit at range with 8P -1AP throwing knives.

I don't know if I would play this character but they're an interesting attempt to make a physical specialist that isn't a troll. Stealth and athletics checks should be made handily and the character can make their way around the city with little trouble.
