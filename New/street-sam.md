####Handle:

Arnold

####Bio:

TBD

####Role:

Ranged mayhem. Rolls 17 to hit with MMG (at 10P -3/-7 (APDS) AP with -5 or -9 to defend). Can lay down 10 rounds before recoil causes him to lose dice. Essentially unperturbed by incoming damage (High pain tolerance + damage compensators => 5 extra wound boxes); 20 armor doesn't hurt either.

####SINs:
