###Name

####Role:


Lots of money for lots of cyberware. Wanted a cool car and a pad because I'm tired of characters who are dead broke at creation. Built around adrenaline pump + will to live. Can sustain massive damage and clutch it out. Ares Alpha is pretty high damage output and 18 to hit is solid.
