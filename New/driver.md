###Max

####Role:

Runner. Driver, really. Don't judge his tricked out step van until you've tried it. Rolls 15 for handling the van, 17 in a bike, remote walker, helicopter...you get the idea. The van can be a getway vehicle or you can whoop ass in it--17 on the rifle or the shotgun with explosive shells. If you can get there in a vehicle, let Max worry about whether or not you should.

Just don't put him in combat; he's squishy.
