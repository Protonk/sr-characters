####Handle:

Condor

####Bio:

A former rank and file of security for a Wuxing subsidiary, he was forced out of his position when the warehouse his team was guarding got pilfered by runners. He may have been paid off, but he's not going to explain what he did or who he worked for, as they may still be looking for him. All we know is he's good with a knife and a pistol and on the lam from somewhere. 

####Role:

I think of this guy like a sneaky face. He's got all the face skills (and a little charisma), but he's *really* good at looking like he belongs somewhere or vanishing entirely.

16 to hit with knives (which hit at 9P -3 AP), 15 to hit with the pistol. Decent dodge, but the real payoff is in full use of stealth skills for a face that can be very good at certain types of combat. Burning edge when hitting an unsuspecting opponent with a knife (no dodge roll unless they overcome surprise, so all hits are net hits) will give 19 dice to hit. 

It's also a type of character (physical adept) that can be interesting in combat, but in an intruiging way. My other adept is all combat--max stats and adept powers (including a quality to boost magic one more). This character sacrifices edge and money to get the maximum practical boost from adept powers while maintaining a broad set of skills and acceptable stats. It's a well rounded role-player.
