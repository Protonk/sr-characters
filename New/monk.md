####Bio:



####Role:

Wreck face. Maybe not the most fun but potentially the most dominant combat character in many settings. 

Exceptional attribute boosts Magic, with the choice of Human (7) and Magic (C) allowing me to maximize both edge and magic. I can then stack on all the flat, undispellable adept powers. It leaves room for minimal skills and money but with a options for ranged and melee as well as lots of mobility.

It's unbelievably tuned. This guy gets 17 dice to hit with the assault rifle. Only 13 to hit with the katana but if I spend an edge I get 19 to hit--I have 6 edge to spend. 17 hits on the assault rifle means that against someone with ~ 10 dodge (pretty standard) I'll hit nearly 90% of the time with an average 2 net hits.

I have 14 + 4D6 initiative. 98% of the time, I'll get three moves in an combat turn. 20% of the time, I'll get four. That means I can spend a turn with a complex full auto burst. I'll get 11 to hit. Burn an edge and that's 17 to hit, but the defender is at -9. For a target that *could* have a high dodge this could be a way to put them away (mean 5 net hits, which gives me an effective 15P -4AP attack).

14 dodge means that against an attacker with 12 dice, I'll dodge 70% of the time, 90% of the time, net hits will be limited to 1, with high pain tolerance affording some margin for hits that land. Damage will be streaky, with dodge after dodge followed up by a serious hit (net hits of 0 => 0 damage bifurcates the outcome a bit).
