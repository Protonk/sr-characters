###Arnold

####Role:

Ranged mayhem. Another fun character (Though Indiana will be more fun with time). This guy is built around the nominally crew-served machine gun. The arm has a gyro built in and the stats are stacked. 

Rolls 19 to hit with MMG (at 10P, -7 AP). Can lay down 11 rounds before recoil causes him to lose dice (one complex full auto or two simple bursts). For the second initiative pass, it's 15 for a simple burst, 12 for a complex burst.

But wait, there's more! He's essentially unperturbed about incoming damage. 21 armor means that most damage will face an 10 + modified armor (likely ~10) damage reduction roll. Whatever gets through will have to move 5 boxes of damage to register a wound, any damage > 1 gets reduced by 1. So the display above can be performed under fire for more than one combat turn. 

Almost all the cyberware is betaware, to keep essense costs down somewhat. Amazingly, I still had lots of money left (not getting rating 2 wired reflexes helps).
