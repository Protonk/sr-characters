###Bucky

####Role:

Karma is plowed into skills, to buttress the 28/2 start. Lots of bioware, but little of it obvious to a casual observer. Really pretty good at the whole throwing grenades and shooting people thing (17 and 20, respectively). Not a slouch at the climbing thing, either (16+ depending on gear).
