####Bio:



####Role:

Topped out drone rigger. Limited skills but near max reaction/logic. Control rolls 18 and gunnery (on startgun weapons) rolls 19 (thresholds for either >1 reduced by 2). Oh, and this character has **7** edge. Any time they need to do something beyond the drone limit, burning an edge will make it so. 

There's some trickery above to get the skills just right. Start w/ 26 karma, spend 4 on money, 7 on a specialization and 4 on active skills. 10 to raise agi from 1 -> 2, 1 on contacts. Then it's a matter of shuffling around 22 skills to get the max from rigger talents. 

And I know it gets boring but reaction dominates again. Reaction is the main stat for control and 3 initiative dice is nice. 

It's a narrow skillset but drones can spy and patrol and you can bring more than one to a job. Pistol is 8 to hit (and concealed in the cyberarm), but the main weapons are the various drones. You could even just zonk out in the van and control 2-3 drones for a run.
