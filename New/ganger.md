###Spiderman

####Role:

Ganger boy wonder. 16 to hit with SMG; gets huge dodge/defense rolls thanks to high REA and combat sense. Can sneak around the urban area fairly well--12 for sneaking and a smattering of social skills/knowledge should get him by. Traceless walk helps slip into alleyways ahead of the police or a rival gang. Decent edge.
