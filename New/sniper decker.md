####Bio:

This guy grew up fending critters off the family farm. Of course it was a body farm, deep in Lakota land, mages bound to points in the earth, submerged in an irreversible coma. And they were paracritters. So he's good with a rifle. Turns out that's a valuable skill in the sixth world. Along the way he's made some money and built up considerable cyberware to hone his skills. 

####Role:

A specialist. He rolls 20 to hit with the sniper rifle. He will hit 85% of the time. 50% of those hits will kill the average NPC threat in medium armor outright. His physical limit is the accuracy of the weapon (7), so net hits can be very high. That's all you really have to say for combat.

He's also a journeyman decker. The deck he has couldn't hack a vending machine but he's got a very nice commlink and lots of tools (as well as the skills to use them). He can focus on tools and bugs: stealing a keycard machine and programming it to accept a fake subscription, installing bugs in offices. The deck is built to perform interactions on an owned target, but does not have a very high rating or stat build. The commlink can perform normal matrix actions with a high rating.

Few contacts, and no fixer, but this is a smart runner that would work well on a team. He can't hack paydata or engage in real matrix combat, but he could probably get a back door open or shut down some security cameras. In tandem with a technomancer or a pure decker this could be devastating. The decker attacks the core AI while the sniper unlocks the back door. Local IC and deckers will be dealing with the "real" threat while  your physical team enters undetected.
