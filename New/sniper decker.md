####Bio:

####Role:

A specialist. He rolls 20 to hit with the sniper rifle. He will hit 85% of the time. 50% of those hits will kill the average NPC threat in medium armor outright. His physical limit is the accuracy of the weapon (7), so net hits can be very high. That's all you really have to say for combat.

He's also a journeyman decker. The deck he has couldn't hack a vending machine but he's got a very nice commlink and lots of tools (as well as the skills to use them). He can focus on tools and bugs: stealing a keycard machine and programming it to accept a fake subscription, installing bugs in offices. The deck is built to perform interactions on an owned target, but does not have a very high rating or stat build. The commlink can perform normal matrix actions with a high rating.
