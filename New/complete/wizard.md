###Jolee

####Role:

Magical weapon. I get 9 magic AND 7 spellcasting (16), +4 for combat spells. Resists drain at 11 and counterspells combat spells at 17.

I had a bit of karma to play with. I spent it on a focus, leaving just enough (2) to boost contacts. Skill groups are spread out. I don't want to be forced to default on stuff where I could be getting a decent attribute bonus.

Even sustaining an increased reflexes I'm at 18 to hit for combat spells. Increased willpower isn't worth it. I need force 6 to meet the minimum and the bonus is *net* hits. I could cheese this with edge and roll a force 1 increased willpower, but I don't super want to do that.

####Bio:

This guy is a regular runner. Middle income, a shitty car, fake licenses to make all that go down smooth with what passes for the law around here. But his astral form is a menace. On the astral plane, he's burning with holy fire. A naive runner might think he's compensating for a dearth of magical skill by loading up power foci, but he's a profoundly adept mage as well. 

An ambush on the astral plane humiliated him in front of his peers and he is chasing high risk combat jobs until the shame lifts--this may never happen. Running may be his new life and a meaner outlet for his considerable power.
