####Ramona

####Role:

True face.

Can potentially roll 13-16 for impersonation (+1 more for con) on the spot. A good disguise--which they're well equipped to make--will force most rolls to see past the disguse to hit thresholds of 7 and up (way more in some situations). Without modifiers this is simply above most NPC's mental limit.

Oh, and she's got plenty of recording equipment and broad electronics knowledge. With the support of a good team, she could bug nearly any building in Seattle.

Etiquette and negotiation tests are lower (9-11) because she's a con artist; first impression is taken to smooth this over for meets with Johnsons and the like. Not so hot at combat--versatile, but no great shakes. 

Almost all adept talents are devoted to deception (plus a mentor spirit). Astral perception is taken to scope out targets and ensure her adept signature (where it can't be masked) won't reveal her disguise. Photographic memory helps her keep stories straight. Karma is spent on a flexible signature focus, with the remainder in contacts.

####Bio:

Not so much the con artist with a heart of gold, but the con artist who has thanksgiving plans to keep. She's still nominally a UCAS citizen, but her parents are stuck in Denver and the paperwork is endless, so getting anything means working in the shadows. She started off wheeling, dealing and conniving trade secrets from fasion companies for a group of local counterfeiters. Planting information blaming the leak on a hapless supplier was icing on the cake. 

Over time she realized that spiriting information in bits and pieces from a tight lipped corporation was more profitable when the target was something like a missile system.
