###Copper

####Role:

May be a lot of slack in this character. Docwagon + lifestyle means I may have spent too much on money. Great at breaking out of stuff (16-18 escape artist will get out of almost every restraint) or getting a small package into a restricted area. Could probably climb through vents that otherwise could only fit a dwarf or drone. 14 to hit with the pistol is acceptable.

####Bio:

If the trids bothered to cover failures, he'd be Elzar the Unremarkable. Years of dedication to the craft never resulted in a big break--he lost an arm on stage performing a signature trick; contraptions would fail on stage; little things never seem to break his way. After a rare string of successes, he borrowed money from some shady characters for cyberware he thought would put him over the edge. It did, in a way. His act bombed again and he took up pilfering info and tools from corporations to pay the bills.
