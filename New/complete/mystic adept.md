###Seeker

####Role:

Respectable but limited magic power, capped by Sorcery spell group. Spell resistance is naturally high, with 10 dice as a baseline. Acceptable at combat: 12-13 to hit, 12 to dodge. Skills, powers and spells focused on investigation and tracking. High enough CHA and WIL to pass dog loyalty tests 2/3rds of the time.

Solid tracking and investigative skills, with good contacts for following up on clues. This is a bit like the adept detective, but with a mystic adept. Disguise and face skills are basically sacrificed for spellpower. 

Have to make the most of a limited skill pool. Karma used to purchase a skill group and 6 power points.
