###Roy

####Role:

Effective support muscle. Good for shaking down targets, hiding from the law and getting info about jobs.

13 to hit with the axe at 11P (reach of 4), 9 to hit with the SMG. 17 armor in the jacket. He's pretty good all around in combat. Can intimidate at 12+, blend in with other gangers at 10+ and find a hideout off the grid at 11+. Well rounded Troll, basically the equivalent stats to a human adept, but with great skills. 

Karma is spent on cash, a focus, and some skills (knowledge and active). We can't default on technical or knowledge skills, so I want to be able to roll on areas the character would know or need. Navigation and tracking are also an option, but he's not great at either (5-8).

____
####Bio:

He's had to learn to hide out in the city, dodging warrants and ruitine patrols, surviving on very little in forgotten corners of the streets. He's a troll, so you know he's muscle, but in many situations he can take someone by surprise and shake the info out of them. No bodies and the police don't come by. 

He has nothing to his name, but he can vanish a team into the docks at will, losing almost any tail. He's not educated or particularly refined (he is a ganger, after all), but he's canny and resourceful. Gangers that are a liability on pay day can be a lifesaver on certain jobs.
