###Barnes

####Role:

Snooper. Can roll 13 to create a resonance channel, 11-15 on listening to targets. They can clean up after themselves and defend themselves in matrix combat, but expertise is plowed into cracking codes and listening in on targets. They can also rig into machines as need be, but they're no rigger.

Incredibly knowledgable about hardware, they can repair or sabotage nearly anything with moving parts. Once a modification is made, they can jump inside the computer to mask the changes against regular scans (no check engine light if you install a bomb). Or they can snoop on a target via their own security system and erase all mention of their intrusion in the logs. 

They can perform their end of the job from a shitty hourly motel at the corner of nowhere and MLK; tunneling up to a target on the grid. If placed in combat they're competent but not adept in any way.
