____
####Handle:

####Role:

A skill heavy mage. FC allows us to maintain an increased reflex spell of force 4, which will boost initiative considerably. 11 to resist drain. Combat spells are cast with 14 to hit.

The mix of skills is interesting. Combat heavy on magical skills, with non-magical built around a survivalist role. Physical stats are low, but willpower and intuition are relatively high, and the low stats are balanced with many survival, stealth and athletic skills. This is a bush wizard. A capable scout--enlightened muscle.
