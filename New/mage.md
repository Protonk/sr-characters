####Bio:

This character was very constrained in terms of resources at creation, so I decided to make a survivalist. They've lived on Salish land (forests and the like, staying away from important shit) for a while and have built up a rappore with the folks living and working there. They may come into Seattle for a job or to buy an artifact but otherwise they live in the wind. They have a satlink, but will only turn it on periodically and far away from any point of value to the Salish or them. 

If you need a top shelf combat mage and you can afford to wait for the right one, you know how to reach him.

####Role:

A skill heavy mage. Combat spells are cast with 14 to hit and combat spells are also resisted at 14 (more if an increased willpower is sustained).

The mix of skills is interesting. Combat heavy on magical skills, with non-magical built around a survivalist role. Physical stats are low, but willpower and intuition are relatively high, and the low stats are balanced with many survival, stealth and athletic skills. This is a bush wizard. A capable scout--enlightened muscle.

Edge and initiative are low, as are resources of any kind.
