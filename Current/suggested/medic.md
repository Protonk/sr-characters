###Doc

####Role:

An effecive combat medit, built around adept powers and high attributes. Uses a sniper rifle as a DMR. Can act with high confidence to secure an area or extract a team member. 

He's 18 \[19\] (laser sight) to hit with the rifle; chosen specifically for accuracy (6 is also my physical limit), damage (12P -7AP) and the ability to place an opponent under stress with burst fire (-2 to defend).

Attacking someone with 12 dodge and 12 armor (fairly decent for a starter enemy), he'll hit 84% of the time with a minimum damage of 8 and a median damage of 14. Defending against 12 attack, he'll dodge 67% of the time.

Natural athlete supports getting places in combat: 9 dice on sprinting rolls. 13 + 4D6 initiative means he has time to spend a full initiative pass performing first aid; in combat first aid rolls 8-13 ***after*** modifiers (limit 5). He's also very good at making sure even the most beat up runners make it back alive.

Anytime I need to snap my fingers and make something happen, I have 7 edge.

####Bio:

Worked for a Souix HRT covering broad swaths of the west. Fly out to trouble and dispense with whatever critters or runners causing same. Since they weren't rescuing hikers, this meant he was a point man for a combat team. They had to find the threat--usually fleeing the scene, occasionally entrenched--and dispatch them, often saving some damn fool civilian who got shot. 

After a while, you see too much (or too broad a picture) and the bosses start to worry. At one point he was unceremoniously retired--not kicked out of the Nation or hunted down, just given a desk job and told they didn't care if he quit. He didn't even know the straw that broke the camel's back. Popping on a half dozen drug tests didn't help.

He is a citizen, so biometrics and magic signature are on file, but the Souix don't seem to care what he does so long as it isn't on Native land. 

Now he's looking for a team.
