####Role:

An effecive combat medit, built around adept powers and high attributes.

The DMR is chosen specifically for accuracy, damage and burst fire. Attacking someone with 12 dodge and 12 armor, he'll hit 84% of the time with a minimum damage of 8 and a median damage of 14.

In combat first aid rolls 8-13 ***after*** modifiers. He's very good at making sure even the most beat up runners make it back alive.

I have 7 edge, 13 + 4D6 initiative and 15 dodge. I need to test this out, but I'm confident this guy could rip a hole through time.

####Bio:

Worked for a Souix HRT covering broad swaths of the west. Fly out to trouble and dispense with whatever critters or runners causing same. Since they weren't rescuing hikers, this meant he was a point man for a combat team. They had to find the threat--usually fleeing the scene, occasionally entrenched--and dispatch them, often saving some damn fool civilian in the process.

After a while, you see too much (or too broad a picture) and the bosses start to worry. At that point he was unceremoniously retired--not kicked out of the Nation or hunted down, just given a desk job and told they didn't care if he quit. He didn't even know the straw that broke the camel's back. Popping on a half dozen drug tests didn't help.

He is a citizen, so biometrics and magic signature are on file, but the Souix don't seem to care what he does so long as it isn't on Native land. 

Now he's looking for a team.
