###Condor

####Role:

He's got all the face skills (and a little charisma), but he's *really* good at looking like he belongs somewhere or vanishing entirely. He can roll 13-15 to sneak into a compund or bluff past the guard with some forged credentials. Taking advantage of social and stealth skills to gain the upper hand will be important, because he is **brutal** in close combat. 

This character sacrifices edge and money to get the maximum practical boost from adept powers while maintaining a broad set of skills and acceptable stats. It's a well rounded glass cannon and an asset to any team.

####Bio:

A former rank and file security officer for a Wuxing subsidiary, he was forced out of his position when the warehouse his team was guarding got pilfered by runners. He may have been paid off, but he's not going to explain what he did or who he worked for, as they may still be looking for him. All we know is he's good with a knife and a pistol and on the lam from somewhere.
