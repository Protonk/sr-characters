____

This guy's a blogger. Don't laugh. He runs a site on various Seattle grids (the location is always changing but it's there if you know how to look) listing fun security vulnerabilities: billboards with old security code, unsecured plumbing systems serving high end enclaves, that sort of thing. Along the way he discovered the less fun vulnerabilities were worth money to the right people. 

____

Goals (in rough order of importance):

- Pay my contact 5k to find a smuggler (con 4, loy 1) (I'd also pay that cost in karma I assume, so 5 karma)
- Pay my rent (11000)
- buy a FN P93 Praetor with a silencer and smartgun system (silencer is 9F, gun is 13F)
  - Willing to pay 2k up front for right of first refusal on the gun from the smuggler. 
- take a whitewater rafting class (2 karma to gain pilot watercraft (1), presumably like 1000 for the class)
- save for rating 4 alphaware skilljack: -0.28 ESS, ~80000 * 1.2 + finder's fee ~ 100000.
  - Willing to pay 6k up front to the smuggler to find a clinic later on.
